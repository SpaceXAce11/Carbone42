I have noticed there are a LOT of differnt Carbone42 color tables that are used by the DOW's.
I have decided to make a bunch of them and upload them. They are free to use and made by me.
I have used the Carbone42 Reflectivity from Wx Tools for the colors <3
All the colortables have the source of the colortable in the file, just open it with notepad to see!
These are all Base Reflectivity, I will make Base Velocity at some point.
